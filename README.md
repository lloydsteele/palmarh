# Computational quantification of palmar hyperlinearity and prediction of filaggrin mutation status from palmar images  

## About

Palmar hyperlinearity is associated with the presence of a loss-of-function mutation in the filaggrin gene (FLG). Loss-of-function mutations in FLG are the strongest genetic risk factor for atopic dermatitis (AD).  Determining palmar hyperlinearity status may thus be useful in clinic and in cohort studies of AD. We created a simple tool to quantify palmar hyperlinearity to overcome current issues where: studies use different definitions of palmar hyperlinearity, there is inter-observer variation, and classifying many images can be time consuming.


### Running Locally

The code is applied to directories of images, separated by filaggrin mutation status. The paths can be changed to calculate hyperlinearity scores for given images, with results output in a csv file.
 

### Project Data

 531 individuals with atopic dermatitis (from Tower Hamlets Eczema Assessment (THEA)  palmar image dataset)
 72 non-atopic individuals
