# Computational quantification of palmar hyperlinearity and prediction of filaggrin mutation status from palmar images  

## About

Palmar hyperlinearity is associated with the presence of a loss-of-function mutation in the filaggrin gene (FLG). Loss-of-function mutations in FLG are the strongest genetic risk factor for atopic dermatitis (AD) and are associated with a particular endophenotype of disease, with more severe and persistent AD, a higher risk of skin infections, and an increased prevalence of food allergies and asthma.  Determining palmar hyperlinearity status may thus be useful in clinic and in cohort studies of AD. However, previous studies have used different definitions of palmar hyperlinearity, making comparison of results between studies difficult. Moreover, classifying palmar hyperlinearity is time-consuming, particularly in large cohort studies, and subject to inter-observation variation. In this study we aimed to: 
1) objectively and quickly quantify palmar hyperlinearity  by generating hyperlinearity scores computationally , and 
2) assess the utility of computational hyperlinearity scores in predicting FLG status.


## Project Data

### Tower Hamlets Eczema Assessment (THEA)  palmar image dataset (531 images included)
### 72 non-atopic individuals


### Running Locally

The code is applied to directories of images, separated by filaggrin mutation status. The paths can be changed to calculate hyperlinearity scores for given images, with results output in a csv file.
