Figure S1. Example of workflow for palmar image applied to external image by Fukuie et al.1

Figure S2. The highest and lowest hyperlinearity scores for (A) thenar and (B) palmar images.\ 
Comparison to original photos (not shown for consent reasons) confirmed the generated scores were appropriate.
