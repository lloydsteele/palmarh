# Computational quantification of palmar hyperlinearity and prediction of filaggrin mutation status from palmar images  

This code generates hyperlinearity scores provided images (palms / thenar eminenence).

external_hyperlinearity_scores_plus_external_ls.ipynb = code to generate hyperlinearity scores, including for external images
predict_flg_status_ls.ipynb = code to predict filaggrin gene loss-of-function mutation
supplementary_data_ls = Supplementary tables and figures
